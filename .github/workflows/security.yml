Perfect 👍 you created the repo on GitHub.

Now we connect your **local project in VS Code** to that repo.

Follow this exactly 👇

---

# 🚀 Step 1 — Open Your Project Folder in VS Code

In VS Code:

* Click **File → Open Folder**
* Open your project folder
  (the one with `server.js`, `package.json`)

---

# 🚀 Step 2 — Open Terminal in VS Code

Press:

```
Ctrl + `
```

Make sure terminal path shows your project folder.

---

# 🚀 Step 3 — Connect to GitHub Repo

Now run these commands one by one:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
```

Now connect to your GitHub repo:

Go to your GitHub repo page and copy the HTTPS URL.

It looks like:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/college-event-portal.git
```

Now run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/college-event-portal.git
git push -u origin main
```

(Replace YOUR_USERNAME)

# 🔐 If It Asks For Login

It may ask:

* Username
* Password

Use:

* GitHub username
* GitHub Personal Access Token (not password)

If you don’t have token, tell me — I’ll guide you.

# ✅ After Push

Refresh your GitHub page.

You should see:

```
server.js
package.json
node_modules (maybe ignored)
```

---

Tell me:

Did `git push` work?
Or did it give an authentication error?
